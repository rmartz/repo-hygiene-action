# Agent guide — repo-hygiene-action

This repo is the **composite GitHub Action** that runs the
[`@rmartz/repo-hygiene`](https://github.com/rmartz/repo-hygiene) checks in a
consuming repo's CI. It holds the CLI as a pinned `package.json` dependency, wraps
it in [`action.yml`](action.yml), and re-releases itself via semantic-release
whenever Dependabot bumps that pin — the chain that ships new check logic to the
fleet. It **dogfoods itself**: CI runs `uses: ./` against this repo's own tree. See
[README.md](README.md) and the [documentation](docs/index.md).

## Documentation — read it first, maintain it every task

The `docs/` bundle is a first-class part of this repo, not an afterthought. On
**every** task:

- **Read first.** Before changing `action.yml`, a workflow, or a config, read the
  relevant [`docs/`](docs/index.md) page(s) and this file, so your change stays
  consistent with what is already documented.
- **Extend, correct, and remove in the same PR.** If your change adds, alters, or
  contradicts anything a doc says — an input, the CLI/library contract, the release
  cadence, a consumer step — fix that doc in the same PR. If a doc describes
  something that no longer exists, delete it. An outdated doc is worse than none.
- **Close gaps you find.** If you notice an undocumented behavior or a stale page
  while doing something else, fix it (or, if truly out of scope, note it) — do not
  leave known-wrong or missing documentation in place.
- **Docs follow OKF.** Pages under `docs/` use Open Knowledge Format frontmatter
  (`type` / `title` / `description` required) and stay reachable from
  [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) under the nested-index rule — an index links
  only same-directory files and a direct child directory's `index.md`. The `okf`,
  `okf-index`, and `docs-links` checks enforce this in CI (they run in the
  Self-hygiene dogfood job). See [docs/okf-format.md](docs/okf-format.md).

## Repository conformance

This repo is held to the shared
[repository checklist](https://github.com/rmartz/ai/blob/main/docs/guidance/repository-checklist.md)
and **self-manages** its own config: fix conformance gaps directly here, in a PR.
Bootstrap (`ai-ensure-*`) is a one-time new-repo starter, not an ongoing manager —
do not defer a fix to a bootstrap re-run, and do not treat a `.github/` file as
off-limits because bootstrap once seeded it.

- **Updates arrive the self-updating way:** the `merge-safety` and `bot-automerge`
  callers and (once consumers migrate) this Action's own pin are bumped by
  Dependabot; CI (incl. PR-title lint + the `commit-convention` tripwire), labels,
  the hardened `dependabot.yml`, and the squash-merge setting are owned here.
- `ai-ensure-labels` / `ai-verify-squash-setting` are useful one-shot helpers, but
  this repo owns its `.github/` config going forward.

## Common commands

```bash
npm ci                 # install deps (needs GitHub Packages auth for @rmartz/*)
npm run format:check   # prettier --check .
npm run format         # prettier --write .
```

There is no build/test suite — the check logic lives in `@rmartz/repo-hygiene`.
This repo's real test is the CI **Self-hygiene (dogfood)** job, which runs the
local action (`uses: ./`) against this tree; run the checks the same way the job
does, or open a PR, to verify a change.

## Releases

Automated via **semantic-release** ([`.releaserc.json`](.releaserc.json)): a merge
to `main` cuts the git tag + GitHub Release. It publishes nothing and commits
nothing back (no `@semantic-release/npm`, no `@semantic-release/git`), so the
built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` suffices — no PAT. `fix:` maps to a patch release (the
stock Conventional-Commits default), so a Dependabot `fix(deps)` bump of
`@rmartz/repo-hygiene` ships a new Action version. PR titles
are Conventional Commits and the repo squash-merges using the PR title, so a
non-conventional title makes semantic-release skip the release.

The Action versions **independently** of the wrapped CLI (its SemVer _number_
describes the _wrapper's_ contract, not the CLI's number), but a CLI dependency bump
**mirrors the CLI's semver bump type** into the Action's release type: patch →
`fix(deps):`, minor → `feat(deps):`, major → `feat(deps)!:` + `breaking change`
label. Patch/minor are auto-merged (safe because the CLI honors SemVer); a **CLI
major** falls out to a human-reviewed PR, defaults to a breaking Action major, and is
downgraded only if the break is confirmed invisible to Action consumers. This is how a
consumer-facing break propagates even when it reaches this repo only as a dependency
bump. The mapping is enforced automatically in `bot-automerge-action`
([#11](https://github.com/rmartz/bot-automerge-action/pull/11)) and will arrive here
as a shared composite action; until then a reviewer applies it by hand (the major is
the enforced case). Full rule:
[docs/design/versioning.md](docs/design/versioning.md).

## Worktrees & PRs

- **Work in a dedicated worktree** under `.git-worktrees/` (`ai-new-worktree`),
  never on `main` in the root checkout. Run `npm ci` in a fresh worktree.
- **PR titles must be Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`,
  `ci:`, …). Render PR/issue numbers as full Markdown links in chat and agent
  output (e.g. `[#12](https://github.com/rmartz/repo-hygiene-action/pull/12)`),
  never a bare `#12`.

## Agent directive files

- **`AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth** for a directory's agent
  instructions — author directives here, never in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Every `AGENTS.md` has a companion `CLAUDE.md`** in the same directory (a bare
  wrapper whose only content is `@AGENTS.md`), enforced by the `md-pairing` check.
  These live at the repo root, outside `docs/`, so they are not pulled into the OKF
  bundle.
